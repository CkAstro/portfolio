         <p>
            All stars shed material in various ways during their lifetimes: explosively, as in nova
            or supernova outbursts, or continuously, in the form of &apos;stellar wind.&apos; Our
            sun only loses a few times 10 <Tex2SVG display="inline" latex="^{-13}" /> of its mass
            each year via its &apos;solar wind,&apos; but more massive or more evolved stars can
            have much higher rates of mass loss. Stellar wind may be produced as radiation from
            within the star interacts with and ejects mass from its upper atmosphere, or as in the
            case of the Sun, simply as a hydrodynamical consequence of the star&apos;s hot{' '}

         <p>
            Mass loss through stellar wind can have a significant impact on a star&apos;s evolution.
            The vast majority of stars (those of{' '}
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_mass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
               low and intermediate mass
            </a>
            ) do not produce a stellar wind of any significance until they complete core hydrogen
            burning and evolve off{' '}
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_sequence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
               main sequence
            </a>
            . Massive stars, however, generate enough radiative force that they will lose a
            significant portion of their mass over their lifespan, with stars above 20 solar masses
            able to shed a sizable portion of their mass during the main sequence phase.
