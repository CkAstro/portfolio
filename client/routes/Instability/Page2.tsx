         <h1>Fluid Instabilities</h1>

         <p>
            In fluid dynamics, an instability occurs when the interface between two fluids is
            disrupted while the fluids are under acceleration or shear.
         </p>

         <div className={css.flexSection}>

               <h2>The Rayleigh-Taylor Instability</h2>
               <p>
                  Occurs when a <b>less</b>-dense fluid is accelerated into a <b>more</b>-dense
                  fluid.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Here on earth, this is easily visible when water (more-dense) is placed over oil
                  (less-dense). Gravity creates a buoyancy force which pushes the oil upward into
                  the water, causing the two to mix.
               </p>
               <p>
                  This process is visible in 2D on the right, or in 3D on the previous page. Pause,
                  rotate, and zoom the figure to really explore the differences.
