         <h1>About the Figure</h1>

         <p>
            The simulation is run assuming two stars are orbiting each other prior to one going
            supernova. Before the explosion, the start begins ejecting its mass in a dense wind,
            which creates a disk about the equatorial plane. This environment is called a
            circumstellar medium (CSM).
         </p>

               <h2>The CSM</h2>
               <p>
                  To the right is a simplified picture. The progenitor star (the one about to
                  supernova) ejects mass at a high rate and creates a dense disk.
               </p>
               <p>
                  This disk will eventually both prevent the supernova blastwave from expanding and
                  prevent light from reaching the camera.
               </p>

               <h2>The Supernova</h2>
               <p>
                  Once the stellar core collapses and the star explodes, material is forced radially
                  outward at over 1/10th the speed of light. Material in the polar region will meet
                  little resistance, while material in the orbital plane will encounter resistance
                  from the dense CSM disk.
               </p>
               <p>
                  This results in an hourglass-like shape in the supernova. The more dense the CSM,
                  the thinner the mid-section is. Bright spots will form near the outer edges of the
                  blastwave (orange in the figure to the left) as surrounding gas is shock-heated by
                  the blastwave.

               <h2>Synchrotron Emission</h2>
               <p>
                  The shock-heated gas will begin to radiate light at all frequencies, with
                  intensity dependent on wavelength.
               </p>
               <p>This light will radiate outward in all directions.</p>
               <p>
                  Although only one light source is shown in this figure, each point on the
                  blastwave is emanating <i>some</i> light.

               <p>
                  Observers on Earth happen to place a camera as shown in the image to the right. We
                  will receive a certain amount of light from this point on the supernova. We will
                  receive some light from all bright spots on the supernova and we can construct an
                  image similar to the figure on the previous page.
               </p>
               <p>But what happens if the system is rotated?</p>

               <h2>A Different Orientation</h2>
               <p>
                  Here, the supernova is rotated 60 degrees. We are in the same location, and now
                  the light must pass through the dense circumstellar medium.
               </p>
               <p>
                  It turns out this will block some of the light we receive. In fact, any light from
                  the &apos;other side&apos; of the dense disk is obscured. Low-frequency light (try
                  setting <Tex2SVG display="inline" latex="\log_{10}(\nu) < 8.5" />) can barely
                  penetrate this and the observer will only ever see one half of the explosion.
                  High-frequency light, however, can penetrate reletively easily and the full
                  supernova may be observed at that wavelength.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Turning on the CSM (blue in the figure on the previous page) will reveal the area
                  blocking the light. Rotating the figure will demonstrate how this light may be
                  revealed at different orientations.
